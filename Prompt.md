Prompt: 

Hey there!

i'd like your help setting up a static documentation site for my app. For now we can just use loren ipsum text to showcase how it would look.

here's the particular styling i'm going for:

https://graphql.org/learn/

I want it to be a dark mode themed site.

So all the content is static but I would like support for search and this will all be hosted on github through their github pages

please initiliaze with this command in this directory 

npx create-docusaurus@latest docs-site classic



npm install @easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local
